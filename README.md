# Hello-World
Start of my Java development journey

Currently just know fundamentals of JAVA(Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation)
The guide in github page said the describe myself so here I am.
If you are reading this, probably just me reading my own commit(yeaaa, I learned a new term).
I am currently a fresh graduate who has been a jack of trades, master of none, not to boast myself.
When I didn't get a job for a fresh graduate software engineer, that's when I decided to entrust my future in Java.

But right now I don't know in which field should I focus with(JavaFX, JEE, and so forth..).
Currently overwhelmed by the vast information of Java, but my dedication will get me through(I hope so..)

I am talking a lot right now so I end it here.
